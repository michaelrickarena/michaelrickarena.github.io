# CS 1XA3 Project02 - <Arenam1>

## Overview

This webpage is Michael Arena's custom CV. At the top of the CV, you will find buttons that allow the user to click which will change the color of the box of my personal information underneath my photo. **Within that box, is a link to my resume**, this is very important to view as it has the needed format for a resume given by the DeGroote school of business. You will be redirected to the PDF if you click "Michael Arena's Resume" which is underlined in the box that changes colours. Underneath my personal information, there is a heading called "Skills". This lists the skills I believe to be my best qualities and rates them in accordance to each. The higher percentage means I have a higher level of knowledge in the subject. Underneath that, you will find the "Languages" heading and this is where I list my best computer science languages in comparison to each other.

Going back to the top of the page there will be a "Programming projects" heading. Under here I list my three proudest projects I have created. **I attach a link at the end of the description** for the user to be able to go to my GitHub account and look through my code to see how Iâ€™ve created these things. Lastly, Underneath the Programming Projects is where you will find Education. Here I outline my educational background and enlighten the user on my two minors and major.


## Custom Javascript Code

There are three features within the javascript code. The first feature is a prompt to ask the user what is name is in which they will input and this name will be saved down in variable "userName". 

Second, Given what the user gave the prompt as their name, it will present them with an alert by addressing them and telling them interesting details that they need to know about the website.

Lastly, The main feature is done by allowing users to click a button at the top of the screen, doing so will change the box with my personal information to a color of their choice. The colors avaliable for them to choose from are blue, red, green, yellow and orange. The styles of the buttons were done through linking *Tachyon* to the HTML to utilize their software which is similiar to bootstrap.
